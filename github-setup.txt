GitHub Setup Commands
====================

After creating your repository on GitHub, run these commands:

1. Add remote origin:
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/stockton-fencing-co.git

2. Push to GitHub:
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username.

After pushing, your repository URL will be:
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/stockton-fencing-co

You'll use this URL to connect to Netlify for automatic deployments.
