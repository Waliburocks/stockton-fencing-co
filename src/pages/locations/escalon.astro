					<h2>Escalon's Agricultural Fencing Specialists</h2>
					<p>As Escalon's premier fence installation company, we understand the unique needs of this close-knit agricultural community. From downtown's historic Main Street to the expansive dairy farms and ranches that define our landscape, we provide specialized fencing solutions for both residential properties and commercial agricultural operations throughout Stanislaus and San Joaquin Counties.</p>

					<p>Escalon's proud heritage as "The Gateway to the Valley" is built on agriculture, particularly dairy farming. Our team brings over 15 years of experience working with local ranchers, dairy operators, and homeowners who need fencing that can handle everything from livestock containment to property beautification. We're not just fence contractors—we're neighbors who understand rural life and the demanding conditions of Central Valley agriculture.</p>

					<p>Every fence we install is engineered to withstand Escalon's challenging climate—scorching summers that regularly exceed 100°F, cold winter nights, seasonal winds, and the occasional flooding from Escalon Creek. Whether you're securing a 5-acre homestead or a 500-acre dairy operation, we use only commercial-grade materials specifically selected for agricultural and rural applications.</p>
