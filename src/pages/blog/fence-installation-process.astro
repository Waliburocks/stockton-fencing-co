	</div>

	<h2>Pre-Installation Planning Phase</h2>

	<h3>Initial Consultation and Site Assessment</h3>
	<p>The installation process begins with a thorough consultation:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Property survey:</strong> Professional measurement of the installation area</li>
		<li><strong>Soil testing:</strong> Assessment of ground conditions and drainage</li>
		<li><strong>Utility marking:</strong> Identification of underground utilities (gas, electric, water)</li>
		<li><strong>Property line verification:</strong> Confirming exact boundary locations</li>
		<li><strong>Design consultation:</strong> Selecting materials, height, and style options</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Permits and Approvals</h3>
	<p>In Stockton, most fence installations require permits:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Building permits:</strong> Required for fences over 6 feet tall</li>
		<li><strong>HOA approval:</strong> Necessary in many residential communities</li>
		<li><strong>Neighbor notification:</strong> Professional courtesy for shared property lines</li>
		<li><strong>Setback compliance:</strong> Ensuring proper distance from property lines</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Installation Timeline</h2>

	<h3>Typical Project Duration</h3>
	<p>Standard fence installation timelines in Stockton:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Small residential projects (up to 100 linear feet):</strong> 1-2 days</li>
		<li><strong>Medium projects (100-300 linear feet):</strong> 2-4 days</li>
		<li><strong>Large projects (300+ linear feet):</strong> 1-2 weeks</li>
		<li><strong>Complex installations:</strong> May require additional time for custom work</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Weather Considerations</h3>
	<p>Stockton's climate affects installation timing:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Best seasons:</strong> Spring and fall for optimal working conditions</li>
		<li><strong>Summer challenges:</strong> Extreme heat may require adjusted work hours</li>
		<li><strong>Winter delays:</strong> Rain can postpone concrete work</li>
		<li><strong>Soil conditions:</strong> Wet ground may require drying time</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Step-by-Step Installation Process</h2>

	<h3>Day 1: Site Preparation</h3>
	<p>The installation begins with thorough site preparation:</p>

		<li><strong>Alignment check:</strong> Ensuring all posts are perfectly aligned</li>
		<li><strong>Cure time:</strong> Allowing 24-48 hours for concrete to fully set</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Panel or Picket Installation</h3>
	<p>Once posts are secure, fencing material is installed:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Panel attachment:</strong> Securing pre-built panels to posts</li>
