	</div>

	<h2>California Fence Law Fundamentals</h2>

	<h3>The "Good Neighbor Fence Act" (California Civil Code 841)</h3>
	<p>California's primary fence law establishes these key principles:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Shared responsibility:</strong> Adjoining landowners are mutually responsible for boundary fence maintenance</li>
		<li><strong>Equal cost sharing:</strong> Both parties should share equally in costs of construction and maintenance</li>
		<li><strong>Presumed agreement:</strong> Existing boundary fences presumed to be shared equally</li>
		<li><strong>Dispute resolution:</strong> Provides framework for resolving fence disagreements</li>
		<li><strong>Applies to:</strong> Boundary line fences between adjoining properties</li>
		<li><strong>Does not apply to:</strong> Fences wholly on one property, not touching the boundary</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Key Legal Definitions</h3>
	<p>Understanding these terms is essential for fence disputes:</p>

	<p><strong>Boundary Fence (Division Fence):</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Fence constructed on or along property line between two parcels</li>
		<li>Serves both properties equally</li>
		<li>Both owners have equal rights and responsibilities</li>
		<li>Subject to shared maintenance and cost rules</li>
	</ul>

	<p><strong>Spite Fence:</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Fence built maliciously to annoy neighbor (California Civil Code 841.4)</li>
		<li>Must be at least 10 feet tall</li>
		<li>Must serve no reasonable purpose</li>
		<li>Can be ordered removed by court</li>
		<li>Owner may be liable for damages</li>
	</ul>

	<p><strong>Encroachment:</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Structure (fence) extending onto neighbor's property without permission</li>
		<li>Can be required to be removed</li>
		<li>May give rise to prescriptive easement if long-term (5+ years)</li>
		<li>Should be addressed immediately when discovered</li>
	</ul>

	<p><strong>Adverse Possession:</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Legal doctrine allowing someone to claim land they've occupied openly for 5+ years</li>
		<li>Requires: continuous, open, notorious, hostile, and exclusive use</li>
		<li>Also requires paying property taxes on the land</li>
		<li>Fence placement can trigger adverse possession claims</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Your Legal Rights as Property Owner</h3>
	<p>What you're entitled to under California law:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Build on your property:</strong> Right to build fence entirely on your land without neighbor permission</li>
		<li><strong>Refuse boundary fence:</strong> Can decline to participate in shared boundary fence</li>
		<li><strong>Choose your side:</strong> Right to have "good side" facing your property if you pay full cost</li>
		<li><strong>Demand survey:</strong> Can require professional survey to establish true boundary</li>
		<li><strong>Maintain your fence:</strong> Can maintain fence on your property as you see fit</li>
		<li><strong>Remove encroachments:</strong> Can demand removal of neighbor's fence from your land</li>
		<li><strong>Legal action:</strong> Can sue for cost recovery, removal, or damages</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Your Legal Responsibilities</h3>
	<p>What California law requires of you:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Share boundary fence costs:</strong> If fence is on property line, must contribute to maintenance</li>
		<li><strong>Provide notice:</strong> Must give written notice before demanding cost sharing</li>
		<li><strong>Respect property lines:</strong> Cannot encroach on neighbor's land without permission</li>
		<li><strong>Maintain your fence:</strong> Shared fences must be kept in reasonable repair</li>
		<li><strong>No spite fences:</strong> Cannot build tall fences solely to annoy neighbor</li>
		<li><strong>Follow codes:</strong> Must comply with local height, setback, and permit requirements</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Determining Exact Property Lines</h2>

	<h3>Why Property Line Location Matters</h3>
	<p>Accurate boundary knowledge prevents most fence disputes:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Legal compliance:</strong> Fence must be on your property or require neighbor agreement</li>
		<li><strong>Avoid encroachment:</strong> Building on neighbor's land creates legal liability</li>
		<li><strong>Establish rights:</strong> True boundary determines who has authority to build</li>
		<li><strong>Cost sharing:</strong> Boundary location affects shared fence responsibilities</li>
		<li><strong>Future sale:</strong> Encroachment issues must be disclosed, can derail transactions</li>
		<li><strong>Insurance claims:</strong> Property line disputes can affect title insurance</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Methods to Locate Property Boundaries</h3>

	<p><strong>Property Survey (Most Accurate):</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>What it is:</strong> Licensed surveyor measures and marks exact property boundaries</li>
		<li><strong>Cost:</strong> $350-900 for typical residential lot in Stockton</li>
		<li><strong>Timeline:</strong> 1-2 weeks from order to completion</li>
		<li><strong>Deliverables:</strong> Survey map, boundary stakes, written documentation</li>
		<li><strong>Legal weight:</strong> Admissible in court, considered definitive</li>
		<li><strong>When needed:</strong> Any time there's uncertainty or dispute about boundaries</li>
	</ul>

	<p><strong>Title Report / Deed Research:</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>What it provides:</strong> Legal description of property boundaries</li>
		<li><strong>Cost:</strong> $150-400 for title report</li>
		<li><strong>Limitation:</strong> Describes boundaries but doesn't physically locate them</li>
		<li><strong>Use:</strong> Starting point for understanding legal boundaries</li>
		<li><strong>Availability:</strong> Title company or county recorder's office</li>
	</ul>

	<p><strong>Property Pins/Monuments:</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>What they are:</strong> Metal or concrete markers placed at property corners</li>
		<li><strong>How to find:</strong> Metal detector, excavation at approximate corners</li>
		<li><strong>Reliability:</strong> Good if original pins, but may have moved over time</li>
		<li><strong>Limitation:</strong> Not always present or findable</li>
		<li><strong>Next step:</strong> Have surveyor verify pins mark true boundary</li>
	</ul>

	<p><strong>Existing Fence Lines (Unreliable):</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Common assumption:</strong> Existing fence marks property line</li>
		<li><strong>Reality:</strong> Fences often installed without survey, may be inaccurate</li>
		<li><strong>Legal weight:</strong> Minimal - fence location doesn't establish boundary</li>
		<li><strong>Risk:</strong> Building new fence on old fence line may continue encroachment</li>
		<li><strong>Best practice:</strong> Never assume fence location is accurate</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>When to Get Professional Survey</h3>
	<p>Situations where survey cost is worthwhile investment:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Before building fence:</strong> Especially if property line unclear or no existing fence</li>
		<li><strong>Neighbor disputes boundary:</strong> Survey provides objective, legal determination</li>
		<li><strong>Before major expense:</strong> Installing expensive fence in wrong location costly mistake</li>
		<li><strong>Irregular lot shapes:</strong> Curved or angled boundaries difficult to estimate</li>
		<li><strong>No visible markers:</strong> Can't locate property pins or monuments</li>
		<li><strong>Old subdivisions:</strong> Older Stockton neighborhoods may have shifted boundaries</li>
		<li><strong>Before property sale:</strong> Encroachment issues derail escrow</li>
		<li><strong>Legal requirement:</strong> Some jurisdictions require survey for fence permits</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Common Fence Dispute Scenarios</h2>

	<h3>Scenario 1: Fence Over Property Line (Encroachment)</h3>

	<p><strong>The Situation:</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Neighbor builds fence partially or fully on your property</li>
		<li>You discover encroachment through survey or observation</li>
		<li>Fence may have been there for years before discovery</li>
	</ul>

	<p><strong>Your Options:</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Request removal:</strong> Ask neighbor to remove fence from your land</li>
		<li><strong>Negotiate easement:</strong> Grant permission for fence to remain (get legal agreement)</li>
		<li><strong>Demand compensation:</strong> Accept encroachment in exchange for payment</li>
		<li><strong>Legal action:</strong> Sue for removal and damages if negotiation fails</li>
		<li><strong>Do nothing:</strong> Risk adverse possession claim if 5+ years pass</li>
	</ul>

	<p><strong>Best Resolution Approach:</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Get survey documenting encroachment</li>
		<li>Discuss findings with neighbor calmly</li>
		<li>Determine if encroachment was intentional or mistake</li>
		<li>Propose solutions: removal, relocation, or written easement</li>
		<li>Get any agreement in writing and record with county</li>
		<li>Act within 5 years to prevent adverse possession</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Scenario 2: Disagreement Over Shared Fence Costs</h3>

	<p><strong>The Situation:</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Boundary fence needs repair or replacement</li>
		<li>One owner wants to proceed, other refuses to pay share</li>
		<li>Dispute over necessity of work or cost amount</li>
	</ul>

	<p><strong>Legal Process for Cost Recovery (California Civil Code 841):</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Provide written notice to neighbor describing needed work</li>
		<li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Include cost estimate and request for cost sharing</li>
		<li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Give neighbor 30 days to respond</li>
		<li><strong>Step 4:</strong> If neighbor agrees, share costs and proceed</li>
		<li><strong>Step 5:</strong> If neighbor refuses, you can proceed and sue for cost recovery</li>
		<li><strong>Step 6:</strong> Small claims court (under $10,000) or civil court for recovery</li>
	</ul>

	<p><strong>Documenting Your Case:</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Take photos showing fence condition and need for work</li>
		<li>Get written estimates from licensed contractors</li>
		<li>Keep copies of all written notices to neighbor</li>
		<li>Document any verbal discussions (date, time, what was said)</li>
		<li>Retain all receipts and invoices for work performed</li>
		<li>Have survey showing fence is on property line (if disputed)</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Scenario 3: Neighbor Wants Different Fence Style</h3>

	<p><strong>The Situation:</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li>You want to build/replace boundary fence</li>
		<li>Neighbor disagrees with material, height, or style choice</li>
		<li>Both want to share costs but can't agree on design</li>
	</ul>

	<p><strong>Legal Framework:</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Your rights:</strong> If you pay 100%, you choose material and style (within codes)</li>
		<li><strong>Shared costs:</strong> Requires agreement on design and specifications</li>
		<li><strong>Default rule:</strong> Law doesn't specify style, only that fence be "reasonable"</li>
		<li><strong>No agreement:</strong> Either party can build fence entirely on their own land</li>
	</ul>

	<p><strong>Compromise Solutions:</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Split difference: each pay portion for preferred height/style</li>
		<li>Good neighbor design: attractive both sides, appeals to both owners</li>
		<li>Phased approach: install basic fence now, upgrade later when both agree</li>
		<li>Separate fences: each build fence on own property (creates dead space between)</li>
		<li>Mediation: use neutral third party to find acceptable compromise</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Scenario 4: Existing Fence Maintenance Dispute</h3>

	<p><strong>The Situation:</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Shared boundary fence deteriorating or damaged</li>
		<li>Disagreement over who responsible for repairs</li>
		<li>One owner neglecting maintenance obligations</li>
	</ul>

	<p><strong>Determining Responsibility:</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Boundary fence:</strong> Both owners share maintenance responsibility equally</li>
		<li><strong>Fence on one property:</strong> Owner of property responsible for maintenance</li>
		<li><strong>Damage caused by one party:</strong> That party responsible for repair costs</li>
		<li><strong>Normal wear:</strong> Shared equally between boundary fence owners</li>
		<li><strong>Previous agreements:</strong> Written maintenance agreements supersede default rules</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Preventing Fence Disputes Before They Start</h2>

	<h3>Best Practices for Dispute-Free Fence Installation</h3>

	<p><strong>Communication Steps:</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Notify early:</strong> Tell affected neighbors about fence plans before starting</li>
		<li><strong>Share plans:</strong> Show design, height, material choices</li>
		<li><strong>Explain reasons:</strong> Help neighbors understand why you're building fence</li>
		<li><strong>Invite input:</strong> Ask for preferences on shared boundary fence</li>
		<li><strong>Address concerns:</strong> Listen to objections and find compromises when possible</li>
		<li><strong>Confirm timeline:</strong> Let them know when work will occur</li>
	</ul>

	<p><strong>Documentation to Create:</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Survey:</strong> Get professional survey before building on/near boundary</li>
		<li><strong>Written agreement:</strong> Document any cost sharing or design agreements</li>
		<li><strong>Permit copies:</strong> Share permit information with neighbors</li>
		<li><strong>Photo documentation:</strong> Take before photos of property conditions</li>
		<li><strong>Contractor details:</strong> Provide neighbor with contractor contact info</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Shared Fence Agreement Template</h3>
	<p>Key elements to include in written boundary fence agreements:</p>

	<div class="cost-table">
		<h3>Essential Agreement Components</h3>
		<table>
			<thead>
				<tr>
					<th>Component</th>
					<th>What to Include</th>
				</tr>
			</thead>
			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td>Property Description</td>
					<td>Legal descriptions and addresses of both properties</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Fence Location</td>
					<td>Exact location (on boundary, X inches inside, etc.)</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Specifications</td>
					<td>Material, height, style, color agreed upon</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Cost Sharing</td>
					<td>How costs split (50/50, other arrangement)</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Maintenance</td>
					<td>Ongoing maintenance responsibilities and cost sharing</td>

				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Binding on Successors</td>
					<td>Agreement applies to future owners of both properties</td>
				</tr>
			</tbody>
		</table>
	</div>

	<p><strong>Legal Recommendations:</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Have attorney review agreement before signing</li>
		<li>Both parties sign and date agreement</li>
		<li>Notarize signatures for added legal weight</li>
		<li>Record agreement with San Joaquin County Recorder</li>
		<li>Provide copy to future buyers when selling property</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>The "Good Side" Question</h3>
	<p>Avoiding disputes over which side of fence faces which property:</p>

	<p><strong>Traditional Approach (Posts on Your Side):</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Support posts face property of person who paid for fence</li>
		<li>Finished side faces neighbor's property</li>
		<li>Shows courtesy and prevents neighbor complaints</li>
		<li>Standard practice for fences built entirely by one owner</li>
	</ul>

	<p><strong>Modern Alternative (Good Neighbor Fence):</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Fence designed to look good from both sides</li>
		<li>Posts between panels rather than behind them</li>
		<li>Eliminates "good side" vs "bad side" issue entirely</li>
		<li>Facilitates cost sharing and neighbor cooperation</li>
		<li>Typically costs 10-15% more than traditional design</li>
	</ul>

	<p><strong>Shared Cost Agreements:</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Specify which side faces which property in written agreement</li>
		<li>Consider alternating directions every X feet for fairness</li>
		<li>Or use good neighbor design and both parties satisfied</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Resolving Active Fence Disputes</h2>

	<h3>Resolution Process Hierarchy</h3>

	<p><strong>Level 1: Direct Negotiation (Try First)</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Approach:</strong> Talk directly with neighbor to find solution</li>
		<li><strong>Cost:</strong> Free</li>
		<li><strong>Success rate:</strong> High if both parties reasonable</li>
		<li><strong>Timeline:</strong> Days to weeks</li>
		<li><strong>Best for:</strong> First attempt at any dispute</li>
	</ul>

	<p><strong>Level 2: Mediation (Recommended Next Step)</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Approach:</strong> Neutral third party helps negotiate agreement</li>
		<li><strong>Cost:</strong> $100-400 per session (often split between parties)</li>
		<li><strong>Success rate:</strong> 70-80% reach agreement</li>
		<li><strong>Timeline:</strong> 1-3 sessions over 2-6 weeks</li>
		<li><strong>Best for:</strong> Complex disputes, strained relations</li>
		<li><strong>Resources:</strong> San Joaquin County Bar Association offers mediator referrals</li>
	</ul>

	<p><strong>Level 3: Small Claims Court (Under $10,000)</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Approach:</strong> Sue for damages or cost recovery</li>
		<li><strong>Cost:</strong> $30-100 filing fee, no attorney needed</li>
		<li><strong>Success rate:</strong> Varies based on documentation and facts</li>
		<li><strong>Timeline:</strong> 2-4 months from filing to hearing</li>
		<li><strong>Best for:</strong> Clear-cut cases with good documentation</li>
		<li><strong>Limit:</strong> Cannot order fence removal, only money damages</li>
	</ul>

	<p><strong>Level 4: Civil Court (Over $10,000 or Injunctions)</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Approach:</strong> Full lawsuit with attorney representation</li>
		<li><strong>Cost:</strong> $3,000-15,000+ in attorney fees</li>
		<li><strong>Success rate:</strong> Varies, but costly even if you win</li>
		<li><strong>Timeline:</strong> 6-18+ months from filing to resolution</li>
		<li><strong>Best for:</strong> Serious encroachments, spite fences, large damages</li>
		<li><strong>Powers:</strong> Can order fence removal, issue injunctions</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>When to Involve Attorneys</h3>
	<p>Situations where legal counsel is worthwhile:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Significant money involved:</strong> Disputes over $5,000+ warrant legal advice</li>
		<li><strong>Adverse possession concerns:</strong> Encroachment existed 5+ years</li>
		<li><strong>Easement issues:</strong> Complex property rights questions</li>
		<li><strong>Title problems:</strong> Encroachment affecting property sale</li>
		<li><strong>Spite fence claims:</strong> Proving malicious intent requires legal expertise</li>
		<li><strong>Property damage:</strong> Fence installation or removal caused damage</li>
		<li><strong>Injunction needed:</strong> Must stop neighbor from proceeding with fence work</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Building Fence to Avoid Boundary Issues</h3>
	<p>Conservative approach preventing most disputes:</p>

	<p><strong>The "6-Inch Setback" Strategy:</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>What it is:</strong> Build fence 6 inches inside your property line</li>
		<li><strong>Advantages:</strong> Clearly on your property, no neighbor permission needed</li>
		<li><strong>Cost implication:</strong> You pay 100%, neighbor has no say in design</li>
		<li><strong>Maintenance:</strong> Entirely your responsibility</li>
		<li><strong>Access:</strong> You can maintain both sides without entering neighbor's land</li>
		<li><strong>Downside:</strong> Lose 6 inches of yard space around perimeter</li>
	</ul>

	<p><strong>Why This Approach Works:</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Eliminates shared fence cost disputes</li>
		<li>No risk of encroachment onto neighbor's property</li>
		<li>You control fence style, height (within codes), maintenance</li>
		<li>Neighbor cannot demand changes or removal</li>
		<li>Survey errors have buffer before causing encroachment</li>
		<li>Future sales cleaner with no shared fence issues</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Special Situations and Considerations</h2>

	<h3>Fences in HOA Communities</h3>
	<p>Additional complications in homeowner associations:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>HOA approval required:</strong> Must get architectural committee approval before installation</li>
		<li><strong>CC&R restrictions:</strong> May specify exact fence styles, heights, colors allowed</li>
		<li><strong>Maintenance standards:</strong> HOA can require upkeep or remove non-compliant fences</li>
		<li><strong>Dispute resolution:</strong> HOA may have its own mediation process</li>
		<li><strong>Three-way disputes:</strong> Conflicts between neighbors + HOA more complex</li>
		<li><strong>Review CC&Rs first:</strong> HOA rules may be more restrictive than city codes</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Corner Lot Complications</h3>
	<p>Corner lots face unique fence challenges:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Two front yards:</strong> Often have two sides subject to front yard height limits</li>
		<li><strong>Visibility triangle:</strong> Area near corner must remain low for traffic safety</li>
		<li><strong>Setback rules:</strong> More restrictive requirements on corner lots</li>
		<li><strong>Multiple neighbors:</strong> More adjoining properties = more potential disputes</li>
		<li><strong>Extra regulations:</strong> City may have special corner lot fence rules</li>
		<li><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Consult Planning Department before any corner lot fence</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Historic Property Considerations</h3>
	<p>Fences in historic districts have additional requirements:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Historic commission approval:</strong> May need approval beyond normal permits</li>
		<li><strong>Style restrictions:</strong> Fence must match historic character of area</li>
		<li><strong>Material requirements:</strong> May require traditional materials (wood, iron)</li>
		<li><strong>Height considerations:</strong> Historic standards may differ from modern codes</li>
		<li><strong>Neighbor disputes:</strong> All parties must comply with historic rules</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Practical Advice for Stockton Homeowners</h2>

	<p>Essential checklist to prevent future problems:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Survey your property:</strong> Know exactly where boundaries are</li>
		<li><strong>Check local codes:</strong> Verify height limits, setbacks, permit requirements</li>
		<li><strong>Review HOA rules:</strong> Confirm compliance with community restrictions</li>
		<li><strong>Talk to neighbors:</strong> Discuss plans, especially for boundary fences</li>

	</ul>

	<h3>If Dispute Arises</h3>
	<p>Steps to take when conflicts emerge:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Stay calm:</strong> Emotional reactions escalate conflicts</li>
		<li><strong>Document situation:</strong> Photos, measurements, written descriptions</li>
		<li><strong>Research your rights:</strong> Understand what law actually requires</li>
		<li><strong>Talk to neighbor:</strong> Many disputes resolve with conversation</li>
		<li><strong>Propose solutions:</strong> Offer reasonable compromises</li>
		<li><strong>Get survey if needed:</strong> Objective facts help resolve boundary disputes</li>
		<li><strong>Try mediation:</strong> Before resorting to legal action</li>
		<li><strong>Consult attorney:</strong> Get legal advice before making major decisions</li>
		<li><strong>Keep records:</strong> All communications, agreements, expenses</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>What NOT to Do</h3>
	<p>Actions that make disputes worse:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Don't remove neighbor's fence:</strong> Even if you think it encroaches (potential criminal charges)</li>
		<li><strong>Don't build without survey:</strong> Guessing boundary location creates liability</li>
		<li><strong>Don't ignore encroachment:</strong> Waiting allows adverse possession claims</li>
		<li><strong>Don't proceed without permits:</strong> Code violations give neighbor ammunition</li>
		<li><strong>Don't make threats:</strong> Threatening language damages your position</li>
		<li><strong>Don't rely on verbal agreements:</strong> Get everything in writing</li>
		<li><strong>Don't assume old fence marks boundary:</strong> Fences often misplaced</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Conclusion: Prevention and Cooperation</h2>

	<p>Most fence disputes are preventable through proper planning, clear communication, and respect for property rights and neighbor relationships. Understanding California fence law empowers you to protect your interests while avoiding unnecessary conflicts that damage both your wallet and your neighborhood harmony.</p>

	<p>The key principles: know your exact property boundaries through professional survey, communicate openly with neighbors before building, get all agreements in writing, follow local codes and obtain required permits, and approach disagreements with willingness to find reasonable compromises.</p>

	<p>When disputes do arise, exhaust negotiation and mediation before resorting to legal action. The cost of litigation - both financial and relational - far exceeds the cost of compromise in most cases. However, know your rights and be prepared to enforce them when neighbors act unreasonably or encroach on your property.</p>
