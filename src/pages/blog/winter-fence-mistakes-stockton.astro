	<div class="intro-section">
		<p class="lead">While Stockton winters are milder than many parts of the country, the combination of rain, wind, and temperature fluctuations can wreak havoc on unprepared fences. Every winter, we see the same preventable mistakes cause thousands of dollars in fence damage across the Central Valley. Here's what you need to know to protect your investment.</p>
	</div>

	<h2>Mistake #1: Ignoring Pre-Winter Inspections</h2>

	<h3>Why It Matters in Stockton</h3>
	<p>Many homeowners assume that because Stockton doesn't get snow, their fence doesn't need winter preparation. This is the costliest mistake you can make. Our winter rains are intense, and existing weaknesses become catastrophic failures when water infiltrates compromised wood or loose posts.</p>

	<h3>What to Look For</h3>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Loose or wobbly posts:</strong> Test every post by pushing firmly at the top</li>
		<li><strong>Cracked or split boards:</strong> Even small cracks expand rapidly when wet</li>
		<li><strong>Peeling paint or stain:</strong> Exposed wood absorbs water like a sponge</li>
		<li><strong>Rust on metal components:</strong> Hinges, nails, and brackets deteriorate quickly</li>
		<li><strong>Signs of rot or insect damage:</strong> Soft spots indicate internal decay</li>
		<li><strong>Drainage issues:</strong> Standing water around fence posts spells disaster</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>The Professional Solution</h3>
	<p>Schedule a professional fence inspection in October or early November. We identify problems you might miss and can make repairs before the rainy season hits. It's far cheaper than emergency repairs in January.</p>

	<h2>Mistake #2: Poor Drainage Around Fence Posts</h2>

	<h3>Stockton's Clay Soil Challenge</h3>
	<p>The Central Valley's heavy clay soil retains water exceptionally well. When rainwater pools around fence posts, several destructive processes begin:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Wood rot accelerates:</strong> Constant moisture causes fungal growth and decay</li>
		<li><strong>Post stability decreases:</strong> Saturated soil loses its structural integrity</li>
		<li><strong>Freeze damage (yes, even here):</strong> We do get occasional freezes, and frozen water expands</li>
		<li><strong>Concrete deterioration:</strong> Post concrete can crack and crumble in standing water</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Drainage Solutions That Work</h3>
	<p>Proper drainage is essential for fence longevity:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Grade the ground away from posts:</strong> Create a 2-3% slope for the first 2 feet</li>
		<li><strong>Install French drains:</strong> Particularly important in low-lying areas</li>
		<li><strong>Use gravel around posts:</strong> 6-8 inches of gravel improves drainage dramatically</li>
		<li><strong>Extend downspouts away:</strong> Don't let roof water pour onto your fence line</li>
		<li><strong>Clear debris regularly:</strong> Leaves and mulch trap moisture against posts</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Mistake #3: Neglecting Wood Treatment and Sealing</h2>

	<h3>The Central Valley Weather Pattern</h3>
	<p>Stockton's unique climate creates a perfect storm for wood damage. We experience:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Heavy winter rains (15-20 inches annually)</li>
		<li>Hot, dry summers that crack and shrink wood</li>
		<li>Rapid temperature fluctuations</li>
		<li>Tule fog that keeps wood damp for extended periods</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Proper Treatment Schedule</h3>
	<p>Untreated wood fences in Stockton should be sealed or stained:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>New fences:</strong> Wait 6 months, then apply quality sealer/stain</li>
		<li><strong>Existing fences:</strong> Retreat every 2-3 years before winter</li>
		<li><strong>High-exposure areas:</strong> South and west-facing sides need annual treatment</li>
		<li><strong>Best timing:</strong> Late September through October (before rains, after summer heat)</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Product Selection Matters</h3>
	<p>Not all sealers are created equal for Central Valley conditions:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Water-repellent sealers:</strong> Essential for our wet winters</li>
		<li><strong>UV protection:</strong> Critical for our intense summer sun</li>
		<li><strong>Mildew resistance:</strong> Important for north-facing sections</li>
		<li><strong>Breathable formulas:</strong> Allow moisture to escape while blocking rain</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Mistake #4: Leaving Vegetation Against the Fence</h2>

	<h3>The Hidden Damage</h3>
	<p>Plants growing against your fence create multiple problems that intensify in winter:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Trapped moisture:</strong> Vegetation holds water against wood, accelerating rot</li>
		<li><strong>Blocked airflow:</strong> Prevents drying between rain events</li>
		<li><strong>Hidden damage:</strong> You can't see problems developing behind plants</li>
		<li><strong>Pest attraction:</strong> Provides shelter for termites and carpenter ants</li>
		<li><strong>Root damage:</strong> Tree and shrub roots can destabilize posts</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Proper Clearance Guidelines</h3>
	<p>Maintain appropriate spacing around your fence:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>6-12 inches minimum clearance:</strong> For all plantings along the fence line</li>
		<li><strong>Trim back vines:</strong> Remove climbing plants before winter</li>
		<li><strong>Clear fallen leaves:</strong> Don't let debris accumulate at the fence base</li>
		<li><strong>Remove dead plants:</strong> Dead vegetation traps moisture and attracts pests</li>
		<li><strong>Keep mulch away:</strong> Maintain 3-4 inch gap between mulch and fence posts</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Mistake #5: Using Inappropriate Hardware</h2>

	<h3>Rust: The Silent Fence Killer</h3>
	<p>Stockton's winter rains expose a common construction shortcut: using non-galvanized or inappropriate hardware. When metal components fail, structural integrity follows.</p>

	<h3>Common Hardware Failures</h3>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Standard nails:</strong> Rust through in 2-3 years of Stockton weather</li>
		<li><strong>Cheap hinges:</strong> Seize up or break during winter storms</li>
		<li><strong>Wrong fasteners:</strong> Screws pull out of wet wood easily</li>
		<li><strong>Unprotected brackets:</strong> Corrode and lose strength</li>
		<li><strong>Poor-quality latches:</strong> Freeze or jam when you need them most</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>The Right Hardware for Central Valley Conditions</h3>
	<p>Invest in quality materials that last:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Hot-dipped galvanized fasteners:</strong> Minimum standard for exterior use</li>
		<li><strong>Stainless steel for gates:</strong> Worth the extra cost for reliability</li>
		<li><strong>Coated screws over nails:</strong> Better holding power in wet conditions</li>
		<li><strong>Weather-resistant hinges:</strong> Self-lubricating types work best</li>
		<li><strong>Quality gate hardware:</strong> Choose heavy-duty over decorative</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Mistake #6: Improper Post Installation Depth</h2>

	<h3>Why Posts Fail in Winter</h3>
	<p>Shallow or improperly installed posts are fence disasters waiting to happen. Winter conditions amplify the problem:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Saturated soil weakens:</strong> Loses ability to hold posts firmly</li>
		<li><strong>Wind leverage increases:</strong> Winter storms create enormous lateral forces</li>
		<li><strong>Frost heaving occurs:</strong> Even occasional freezing can lift shallow posts</li>
		<li><strong>Erosion accelerates:</strong> Heavy rains wash away supporting soil</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Proper Installation Standards for Stockton</h3>
	<p>Posts must be installed to withstand our conditions:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Minimum depth:</strong> 1/3 of total post length (24" minimum for 6' fence)</li>
		<li><strong>Concrete footings:</strong> Required for all permanent installations</li>
		<li><strong>Proper concrete mix:</strong> Fast-setting alone isn't enough; use structural mix</li>
		<li><strong>Adequate diameter:</strong> 12-inch diameter minimum for 4x4 posts</li>
		<li><strong>Gravel base:</strong> 4-6 inches of gravel under post improves drainage</li>
		<li><strong>Crown the concrete:</strong> Slope away from post to shed water</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Mistake #7: Delaying Minor Repairs</h2>

	<h3>The Compounding Effect</h3>
	<p>Small problems become catastrophic failures when winter weather hits. What could be a $50 repair in October becomes a $1,500 emergency in January.</p>

	<h3>Common "Small" Problems That Escalate</h3>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Loose board:</strong> Becomes multiple broken boards in first windstorm</li>
		<li><strong>Wobbly post:</strong> Entire section collapses under wind load</li>
		<li><strong>Small crack in wood:</strong> Splits completely when water freezes inside</li>
		<li><strong>Stuck gate latch:</strong> Gate blows open, breaks hinges and frame</li>
		<li><strong>Missing paint spot:</strong> Wood rot spreads to entire board</li>
		<li><strong>Slight lean:</strong> Posts pull completely out of ground</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>The Pre-Winter Repair Priority List</h3>
	<p>Address these issues before December:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Immediate (do now):</strong> Loose posts, broken boards, gate issues</li>
		<li><strong>High priority (within 2 weeks):</strong> Cracks, peeling finish, drainage problems</li>
		<li><strong>Medium priority (within month):</strong> Rust spots, minor rot, vegetation removal</li>
		<li><strong>Plan for spring:</strong> Full refinishing, post replacement, major upgrades</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Prevention: Your Winter Fence Checklist</h2>

	<h3>October Action Items</h3>
	<p>Complete these tasks before November rains arrive:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>☐ Schedule professional fence inspection</li>
		<li>☐ Test all posts for stability</li>
		<li>☐ Check and improve drainage around fence line</li>
		<li>☐ Clean gutters and redirect downspouts away from fence</li>
		<li>☐ Apply sealer or stain to wood fences</li>
		<li>☐ Trim back all vegetation touching fence</li>
		<li>☐ Lubricate gate hinges and hardware</li>
		<li>☐ Tighten all loose fasteners</li>
		<li>☐ Replace any rusted hardware</li>
		<li>☐ Make all necessary repairs</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>During Winter Maintenance</h3>
	<p>Stay proactive throughout the rainy season:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>☐ Clear debris from fence base after storms</li>
		<li>☐ Check for new leaning or damage after high winds</li>
		<li>☐ Ensure drainage is working properly</li>
		<li>☐ Address new problems immediately</li>
		<li>☐ Keep vegetation trimmed back</li>
	</ul>
