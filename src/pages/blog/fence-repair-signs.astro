	<div class="intro-section">
		<p class="lead">Your fence is more than just a boundary markerâ€”it's a critical investment in your property's security, privacy, and curb appeal. Recognizing the early warning signs of fence damage can save you hundreds or even thousands of dollars by addressing issues before they require complete replacement.</p>
		
		<p>As professional fencing contractors serving the Stockton area for over 15 years, we've seen how small problems can quickly escalate into major headaches. Here are the five most critical signs that indicate your fence needs immediate professional attention.</p>
	</div>

	<section class="sign-section">
		<h2>1. Leaning or Tilting Posts</h2>
		<p><strong>The Problem:</strong> Fence posts that lean at noticeable angles are a clear indication of foundation issues. This can be caused by:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Soil erosion around the post base</li>
			<li>Inadequate initial installation depth</li>
			<li>Root damage from nearby trees</li>
			<li>Ground settling or shifting</li>
			<li>Weather damage from strong winds</li>
		</ul>
		<p><strong>Why It's Urgent:</strong> Leaning posts compromise the entire fence section's stability. What starts as a slight lean can quickly become a domino effect, causing adjacent sections to fail and potentially creating safety hazards.</p>
		<p><strong>Professional Solution:</strong> Our team will assess whether posts can be straightened and reinforced, or if replacement is necessary. We use proper concrete setting techniques and appropriate post depths for Stockton's soil conditions.</p>
	</section>

	<section class="sign-section">
		<h2>2. Loose or Missing Boards/Panels</h2>
		<p><strong>The Problem:</strong> Individual fence boards that have come loose or fallen off entirely indicate:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Failing fasteners (nails, screws, brackets)</li>
			<li>Wood rot or material deterioration</li>
			<li>Impact damage from weather or accidents</li>
			<li>Natural expansion and contraction cycles</li>
		</ul>
		<p><strong>Why It's Urgent:</strong> Loose boards create security gaps and can become projectiles in windy conditions. Missing boards allow easy access to your property and reduce privacy. Additionally, the remaining boards experience increased stress, leading to more failures.</p>
		<p><strong>Professional Solution:</strong> We'll replace damaged boards with matching materials and upgrade fasteners to prevent future issues. For older fences, we may recommend panel reinforcement to extend the fence's overall lifespan.</p>
	</section>

	<section class="sign-section">
		<h2>3. Visible Rust or Corrosion</h2>
		<p><strong>The Problem:</strong> On metal fences (chain link, iron, aluminum), rust and corrosion appear as:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Orange or brown discoloration</li>
			<li>Flaking or bubbling paint</li>
			<li>Weakened connections at joints</li>
			<li>Holes developing in the material</li>
		</ul>
		<p><strong>Why It's Urgent:</strong> Rust spreads rapidly, especially in Stockton's variable weather conditions. Once corrosion takes hold, it weakens the structural integrity of the entire fence system. Early intervention is much more cost-effective than replacement.</p>
		<p><strong>Professional Solution:</strong> We provide rust treatment, protective coatings, and section replacement as needed. Our team uses high-quality galvanized and powder-coated materials designed to withstand local weather conditions.</p>
	</section>

	<section class="sign-section">
		<h2>4. Sagging or Damaged Gates</h2>
		<p><strong>The Problem:</strong> Gates that don't close properly, drag on the ground, or require lifting to operate indicate:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Hinge wear or failure</li>
			<li>Gate frame distortion</li>
			<li>Foundation settling</li>
			<li>Hardware deterioration</li>
		</ul>
		<p><strong>Why It's Urgent:</strong> A non-functioning gate defeats the purpose of having a fence. It compromises security and can cause injury if it falls unexpectedly. Gate problems also often indicate issues with the supporting posts that could affect adjacent fence sections.</p>
		<p><strong>Professional Solution:</strong> Our experts will assess whether the gate can be realigned and repaired, or if replacement is necessary. We upgrade to heavy-duty hinges and latches designed for long-term durability.</p>
	</section>

	<section class="sign-section">
		<h2>5. Storm or Impact Damage</h2>
		<p><strong>The Problem:</strong> Stockton's seasonal winds, occasional storms, and accidental impacts can cause:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Bent or broken fence sections</li>
			<li>Uprooted posts</li>
			<li>Debris damage to materials</li>
			<li>Structural misalignment</li>
		</ul>
		<p><strong>Why It's Urgent:</strong> Storm damage often affects multiple components simultaneously. Delayed repairs can lead to further deterioration, especially if water penetration occurs. Insurance coverage may also have time limitations for filing claims.</p>
		<p><strong>Professional Solution:</strong> We provide emergency repair services and work directly with insurance companies when applicable. Our team can quickly secure your property and develop a comprehensive repair plan.</p>
	</section>

	<section class="prevention-section">
		<h2>Prevention is Key</h2>
		<p>While some damage is inevitable, regular maintenance can significantly extend your fence's lifespan:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Annual Inspections:</strong> Walk your fence line at least twice yearly</li>
			<li><strong>Prompt Attention:</strong> Address small issues immediately</li>
			<li><strong>Proper Cleaning:</strong> Remove debris and vegetation that can cause damage</li>
			<li><strong>Professional Maintenance:</strong> Schedule periodic professional assessments</li>
		</ul>
