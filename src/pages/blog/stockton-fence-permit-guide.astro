		<p class="lead">Installing a fence in Stockton without proper permits can result in fines up to $500 per day, forced removal, and complications when selling your home. This comprehensive guide covers everything you need to know about Stockton's fence permit requirements, application process, and compliance standards for 2024.</p>
	</div>

	<h2>Do You Need a Permit for Your Fence in Stockton?</h2>

	<h3>When Permits Are Required</h3>
	<p>In Stockton, California, you need a building permit for most fence installations. Here's the breakdown:</p>

	<h4>Permits Definitely Required For:</h4>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Fences over 6 feet tall:</strong> Any fence exceeding 72 inches requires a permit</li>
		<li><strong>Front yard fences over 4 feet:</strong> Stricter height restrictions apply to street-facing sides</li>
		<li><strong>Corner lot fences:</strong> Special visibility regulations apply</li>
		<li><strong>Fences near property lines:</strong> Most residential fences on boundaries need permits</li>
		<li><strong>Pool enclosures:</strong> Must meet specific safety code requirements</li>
		<li><strong>Commercial property fences:</strong> All commercial fencing requires permits</li>
		<li><strong>Structural changes:</strong> Moving or replacing existing fence in new location</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Situations That May Not Require Permits:</h4>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Repairs to existing fences:</strong> Replacing like-for-like without structural changes</li>
		<li><strong>Temporary construction fencing:</strong> With time limitations</li>
