	<div class="intro-section">
		<p class="lead">Central Valley wind events regularly damage or destroy poorly engineered fences. Stockton homeowners routinely experience sustained winds of 20-30 mph with gusts exceeding 50 mph during winter and spring storms. A fence not designed for these wind loads will lean, break, or completely blow down - often taking sections of neighbor's fencing with it.</p>

		<p>This comprehensive engineering guide explains exactly how to design and install fencing that withstands Central Valley wind conditions. You'll learn the physics of wind loads, critical design elements that prevent failure, proper installation techniques including post depth and spacing, material choices for wind resistance, and real-world solutions that keep fences standing through decades of storm events.</p>
	</div>

	<h2>Understanding Central Valley Wind Conditions</h2>

	<h3>Stockton Wind Climate Data</h3>
	<p>Know what your fence must withstand:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Average wind speed:</strong> 7-10 mph year-round</li>
		<li><strong>Common sustained winds:</strong> 15-25 mph during weather events</li>
		<li><strong>Regular gusts:</strong> 30-40 mph several times per year</li>
		<li><strong>Extreme events:</strong> 50-60+ mph gusts during major storms</li>
		<li><strong>Peak wind season:</strong> November through March (winter storm systems)</li>
		<li><strong>Secondary peak:</strong> March through May (spring storm systems)</li>
		<li><strong>Wind direction:</strong> Predominantly westerly and southwesterly</li>
		<li><strong>Delta breeze:</strong> Consistent summer afternoon winds 10-20 mph</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>How Wind Damages Fences</h3>
	<p>Understanding failure modes helps prevent them:</p>

	<p><strong>Post Pull-Out/Lean:</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Cause:</strong> Posts set too shallow or with inadequate concrete</li>
		<li><strong>Appearance:</strong> Fence panels lean progressively in wind direction</li>
		<li><strong>Progression:</strong> Starts with slight lean, worsens with each wind event</li>
		<li><strong>Most common in:</strong> Clay soils that soften when wet</li>
		<li><strong>Prevention:</strong> Proper depth (1/3 total height minimum) and concrete mass</li>
	</ul>

	<p><strong>Panel Blow-Out:</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Cause:</strong> Solid panels create excessive wind load (sail effect)</li>
		<li><strong>Appearance:</strong> Entire panels rip away from posts</li>
		<li><strong>Progression:</strong> Sudden failure during high wind event</li>
		<li><strong>Most common in:</strong> Tall solid fences (6+ feet) with standard spacing</li>
		<li><strong>Prevention:</strong> Closer post spacing, stronger connections, wind breaks in design</li>
	</ul>

	<p><strong>Connection Failure:</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Cause:</strong> Inadequate fasteners or mounting methods</li>
		<li><strong>Appearance:</strong> Panels separate from posts at attachment points</li>
		<li><strong>Progression:</strong> Screws pull out or brackets break during sustained wind</li>
		<li><strong>Most common in:</strong> Fences using minimal or improper fasteners</li>
		<li><strong>Prevention:</strong> Proper fastener type, quantity, and placement</li>
	</ul>

	<p><strong>Material Failure:</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Cause:</strong> Wood splits, vinyl cracks, metal bends under stress</li>
		<li><strong>Appearance:</strong> Pickets break, panels crack, aluminum bends</li>
		<li><strong>Progression:</strong> Degraded materials fail at weak points</li>
		<li><strong>Most common in:</strong> Aged or low-quality materials</li>
		<li><strong>Prevention:</strong> Quality materials rated for wind loads</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Wind Load Calculations</h3>
	<p>Basic physics determining fence engineering requirements:</p>

	<p><strong>Key Factors in Wind Load:</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Wind speed:</strong> Load increases with square of wind speed (50 mph = 4x force of 25 mph)</li>
		<li><strong>Fence height:</strong> Taller fences catch more wind, create greater leverage on posts</li>
		<li><strong>Panel solidity:</strong> Solid panels catch full wind; open designs let wind pass through</li>
		<li><strong>Exposure:</strong> Open areas experience higher winds than sheltered locations</li>
		<li><strong>Fence orientation:</strong> Perpendicular to prevailing wind takes maximum load</li>
	</ul>

	<p><strong>Simplified Load Estimation:</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>50 mph wind on 6-ft solid fence:</strong> ~50 lbs per linear foot of panel</li>
		<li><strong>60 mph wind on 6-ft solid fence:</strong> ~70 lbs per linear foot of panel</li>
		<li><strong>8-ft panel at 6 feet spacing:</strong> 400-560 lbs total force per panel</li>
		<li><strong>Posts must resist:</strong> Both the direct force and the leverage (moment)</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Design Elements for Wind Resistance</h2>

	<h3>Post Specifications - The Critical Foundation</h3>

	<p><strong>Post Size Requirements:</strong></p>

	<div class="cost-table">
		<h3>Minimum Post Sizes for Wind Resistance</h3>

		</table>
	</div>

	<p><strong>Post Depth Requirements:</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Minimum depth:</strong> 1/3 of total post height (includes above-ground portion)</li>
		<li><strong>Standard 6-ft fence:</strong> 24-30 inches deep minimum</li>
		<li><strong>High-wind 6-ft fence:</strong> 30-36 inches deep recommended</li>
		<li><strong>8-ft fence:</strong> 36-42 inches deep minimum</li>
		<li><strong>Clay soil areas:</strong> Add 6 inches to standard depths</li>
		<li><strong>Frost depth consideration:</strong> Below frost line to prevent heaving (12" in Stockton)</li>
	</ul>

	<p><strong>Post Spacing for Wind Loads:</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Standard spacing:</strong> 8 feet on center (adequate for 4-6 ft fence, normal exposure)</li>
		<li><strong>High-wind spacing:</strong> 6 feet on center (recommended for 6+ ft fence)</li>
		<li><strong>Extreme conditions:</strong> 5 feet on center (exposed 8-ft fences)</li>
		<li><strong>Cost impact:</strong> Closer spacing adds 25-33% to material cost but prevents failure</li>
		<li><strong>Gate posts:</strong> Always use larger posts (6x6 minimum) and deeper setting</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Concrete Foundation Critical for Wind Resistance</h3>

	<p><strong>Concrete Specifications:</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Minimum diameter:</strong> 10-12 inches for standard 4x4 posts</li>
		<li><strong>High-wind diameter:</strong> 12-14 inches for better wind resistance</li>
		<li><strong>Concrete depth:</strong> Full depth of hole (not just bottom portion)</li>
		<li><strong>Mix strength:</strong> 3,000 PSI minimum (standard ready-mix)</li>
		<li><strong>Curing time:</strong> Minimum 48 hours before loading, 7 days for full strength</li>
		<li><strong>Gravel base:</strong> 4-6 inches of gravel below concrete for drainage</li>
	</ul>

	<p><strong>Post-Concrete Connection Methods:</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Direct embed:</strong> Post set directly in concrete (most common, adequate)</li>
		<li><strong>Post base anchor:</strong> Metal bracket anchored in concrete, post bolts to it</li>
		<li><strong>Hybrid method:</strong> Post in concrete plus anchor bolt through bottom</li>
		<li><strong>Best for wind:</strong> Direct embed in properly sized concrete mass</li>
	</ul>

	<p><strong>Special Concrete Techniques for Clay Soil:</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Problem:</strong> Clay expands when wet, contracts when dry (stresses posts)</li>
		<li><strong>Solution 1:</strong> Plastic sleeve around concrete (allows independent movement)</li>
		<li><strong>Solution 2:</strong> Gravel collar around top of concrete (drainage + flex space)</li>
		<li><strong>Solution 3:</strong> Bell-bottom hole (wider at bottom creates anchor)</li>
		<li><strong>All methods:</strong> Prevent clay soil movement from breaking concrete bond</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Panel Design for Wind Load Reduction</h3>

	<p><strong>Solid Panel Modifications:</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Horizontal gaps:</strong> 1-2" space between board rows (reduces wind load 30-40%)</li>
		<li><strong>Lattice top sections:</strong> Replace top 12-18" with lattice (decorative + functional)</li>
		<li><strong>Alternating board width:</strong> Creates gaps while maintaining privacy screening</li>
		<li><strong>Shadow box design:</strong> Boards on both sides with gaps (reduces load, adds style)</li>
		<li><strong>Vertical vs horizontal:</strong> Horizontal boards slightly better wind performance</li>
	</ul>

	<p><strong>Open Design Options:</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Semi-privacy spacing:</strong> 1-2" gaps between all pickets/boards</li>
		<li><strong>Ornamental aluminum:</strong> Open design inherently wind-resistant</li>
		<li><strong>Horizontal slat with gaps:</strong> Modern look, excellent wind performance</li>
		<li><strong>Chain link:</strong> Maximum wind flow, but minimal privacy</li>
		<li><strong>Louvered designs:</strong> Angled slats provide privacy while allowing wind passage</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Material Choices for Wind Resistance</h2>

	<h3>Wood Fence Wind Performance</h3>

	<p><strong>Best Wood Species for Wind:</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Redwood:</strong> Lightweight yet strong, flexible enough to flex in wind</li>
		<li><strong>Cedar:</strong> Good strength-to-weight ratio, naturally flexible</li>
		<li><strong>Pressure-treated pine:</strong> Heavier but adequately strong if properly installed</li>
		<li><strong>Avoid:</strong> Untreated pine, fir (weakens over time in weather)</li>
	</ul>

	<p><strong>Board Thickness Considerations:</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Standard pickets:</strong> 5/8" thick adequate for most applications</li>
		<li><strong>High-wind areas:</strong> 3/4" - 1" thick boards more resistant to breaking</li>
		<li><strong>Horizontal boards:</strong> Use 2x6 or 2x8 (laid flat) for maximum strength</li>
		<li><strong>Rails:</strong> 2x4 minimum, 2x6 for high-wind or tall fences</li>
	</ul>

	<p><strong>Wood Fence Wind Vulnerabilities:</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Weight:</strong> Heavy solid panels create high wind loads</li>
		<li><strong>Moisture content:</strong> Wet wood heavier, increases stress on posts</li>
		<li><strong>Aging:</strong> Wood weakens over time, especially at fastener points</li>
		<li><strong>Knots:</strong> Natural weak points where boards can break</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Vinyl Fence Wind Performance</h3>

	<p><strong>Vinyl Wind Resistance Advantages:</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Vinyl flexes in wind rather than breaking rigidly</li>
		<li><strong>Lightweight:</strong> Less mass means lower wind loads on posts</li>
		<li><strong>Consistent strength:</strong> No knots or weak spots like wood</li>
		<li><strong>No moisture weight:</strong> Doesn't absorb water and become heavier</li>
		<li><strong>Integrated design:</strong> Panels interlock with posts for strong connection</li>
	</ul>

	<p><strong>Vinyl Wind Resistance Concerns:</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Temperature brittleness:</strong> Cold weather makes vinyl less flexible</li>
		<li><strong>UV degradation:</strong> Low-quality vinyl becomes brittle over years</li>
		<li><strong>Large panel area:</strong> Solid panels still catch significant wind</li>
		<li><strong>Post connection:</strong> Critical that posts properly reinforced for vinyl</li>
	</ul>

	<p><strong>Vinyl Wind Resistance Specifications:</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Thickness:</strong> Minimum 0.130" wall thickness for 6-ft fence</li>
		<li><strong>Reinforcement:</strong> Aluminum or steel inserts in rails and posts (essential for wind)</li>
		<li><strong>Virgin vinyl:</strong> Only virgin vinyl has flexibility needed for wind resistance</li>
		<li><strong>UV protection:</strong> UV inhibitors throughout material prevent brittleness</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Metal Fence Wind Performance</h3>

	<p><strong>Aluminum Fence (Best Wind Performance):</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Open design:</strong> Wind passes through rather than creating load</li>
		<li><strong>Lightweight:</strong> Minimal stress on posts from fence weight</li>
		<li><strong>Strong materials:</strong> Aluminum strength excellent for open designs</li>
		<li><strong>Flexible enough:</strong> Will bend rather than break in extreme winds</li>
		<li><strong>Ideal application:</strong> Windy locations where privacy not required</li>
	</ul>

	<p><strong>Steel/Wrought Iron Fence:</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Maximum strength:</strong> Strongest fence material available</li>
		<li><strong>Weight factor:</strong> Heavy material requires substantial posts and foundations</li>
		<li><strong>Rigid design:</strong> Won't flex - relies on pure strength</li>
		<li><strong>Excellent for wind:</strong> If properly installed with adequate foundations</li>
		<li><strong>Cost consideration:</strong> Most expensive option</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Installation Techniques for Wind Resistance</h2>

	<h3>Post Installation Best Practices</h3>

	<p><strong>Step-by-Step Wind-Resistant Installation:</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Dig holes to proper depth (1/3 total height + 6" gravel)</li>
		<li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Add 4-6" gravel base, tamp firmly</li>
		<li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Set post in center of hole, verify plumb in both directions</li>
		<li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Temporary bracing to hold post plumb during concrete cure</li>
		<li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Fill hole with concrete, vibrate to remove air pockets</li>
		<li><strong>Step 6:</strong> Crown concrete top slightly for water runoff</li>
		<li><strong>Step 7:</strong> Allow full 48-hour cure before attaching panels</li>
		<li><strong>Step 8:</strong> Final verification of post plumb before panel installation</li>
	</ul>

	<p><strong>Critical Installation Details:</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Hole diameter:</strong> 3x post width minimum (4x4 post needs 12" hole)</li>
		<li><strong>Post alignment:</strong> Must be perfectly plumb in both directions</li>
		<li><strong>Concrete consistency:</strong> Not too wet (weakens) or too dry (air pockets)</li>
		<li><strong>Cure time:</strong> Don't rush - improper cure severely weakens concrete</li>
		<li><strong>Corner posts:</strong> Even deeper and larger concrete mass for leverage points</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Panel Attachment Methods</h3>

	<p><strong>Fastener Requirements for Wind:</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Screw type:</strong> #8 or #10 exterior-rated screws (deck screws ideal)</li>
		<li><strong>Screw length:</strong> Penetrate posts minimum 1.5 inches</li>
		<li><strong>Quantity:</strong> 2-3 screws per rail-to-post connection (not just one!)</li>
		<li><strong>Spacing:</strong> Screws every 6-8 inches along rails</li>
		<li><strong>Pilot holes:</strong> Pre-drill to prevent wood splitting</li>
		<li><strong>Avoid nails:</strong> Nails pull out in wind; screws essential</li>
	</ul>

	<p><strong>Bracket Systems for Enhanced Strength:</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Metal rail brackets:</strong> Bolt through post for maximum strength</li>
		<li><strong>Hurricane clips:</strong> Additional tie-downs for extreme wind areas</li>
		<li><strong>Post-to-panel brackets:</strong> Distribute load across larger area</li>
		<li><strong>Cost addition:</strong> $2-5 per bracket, but significantly increases wind resistance</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Rail Configuration</h3>

	<p><strong>Optimal Rail Design:</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Number of rails:</strong> 3 rails better than 2 for tall fences (top, middle, bottom)</li>
		<li><strong>Rail size:</strong> 2x4 minimum, 2x6 for 8-ft fences or high-wind areas</li>
		<li><strong>Orientation:</strong> Rails on edge (4" dimension vertical) stronger than flat</li>
		<li><strong>Attachment:</strong> Screws through pickets into rails every 6-8 inches</li>
		<li><strong>Continuous rails:</strong> Don't butt rails end-to-end between posts (weak point)</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Special Considerations for High-Wind Areas</h2>

	<h3>Identifying High-Wind Exposure on Your Property</h3>

	<p><strong>High-Wind Indicators:</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Open fields nearby:</strong> No windbreak from trees or structures</li>
		<li><strong>Top of hills/ridges:</strong> Elevated locations catch more wind</li>
		<li><strong>End of wind tunnels:</strong> Between buildings or geographic features</li>
		<li><strong>West or south facing:</strong> Perpendicular to prevailing Central Valley winds</li>
		<li><strong>Near waterways:</strong> Delta channels create wind corridors</li>
		<li><strong>Previous damage:</strong> If old fence blew down, location is high-wind</li>
	</ul>

	<p><strong>Enhanced Engineering for High-Wind Sites:</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Reduce post spacing:</strong> 6 feet instead of 8 feet</li>
		<li><strong>Increase post size:</strong> 6x6 instead of 4x4</li>
		<li><strong>Deeper installation:</strong> Add 6 inches to standard depth</li>
		<li><strong>Larger concrete mass:</strong> 14-16" diameter holes</li>
		<li><strong>Panel modifications:</strong> Add gaps or lattice sections to reduce wind load</li>
		<li><strong>Lower height:</strong> Consider 5-ft fence instead of 6-ft (significantly less load)</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Wind Break Strategies</h3>

	<p><strong>Using Landscape as Wind Protection:</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Tree windbreaks:</strong> Plant fast-growing trees on windward side</li>
		<li><strong>Shrub buffers:</strong> Dense shrub rows absorb wind energy before hitting fence</li>
		<li><strong>Berms:</strong> Raised earth berms deflect wind over fence</li>
		<li><strong>Multi-layer approach:</strong> Trees, shrubs, fence create progressive wind reduction</li>
		<li><strong>Spacing:</strong> Windbreak vegetation 10-20 feet from fence for best effect</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Temporary Wind Protection During Installation</h3>
	<p>New fences are vulnerable during installation and curing:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Phased installation:</strong> Don't install panels until all posts fully cured</li>
		<li><strong>Weather monitoring:</strong> Avoid installing panels before predicted wind events</li>
		<li><strong>Temporary bracing:</strong> Additional bracing for first 7 days after installation</li>
		<li><strong>Partial installation:</strong> Install few panels, verify stability, proceed gradually</li>
		<li><strong>Post-cure time:</strong> Allow 48 hours minimum, 7 days ideal before loading posts</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Maintenance for Long-Term Wind Resistance</h2>

	<h3>Annual Inspection Checklist</h3>
	<p>Catch problems before wind events cause catastrophic failure:</p>

	<p><strong>Post Inspection:</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Check for lean:</strong> Any posts leaning even slightly need immediate attention</li>
		<li><strong>Base condition:</strong> Look for gaps around post base (soil erosion or settling)</li>
		<li><strong>Concrete cracks:</strong> Major cracks indicate foundation problems</li>
		<li><strong>Wood rot:</strong> Check post base for soft spots (replace before wind season)</li>
		<li><strong>Movement test:</strong> Push on post - should feel rock solid, no give</li>
	</ul>

	<p><strong>Panel and Connection Inspection:</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Loose fasteners:</strong> Tighten or replace any loose screws/bolts</li>
		<li><strong>Cracked boards:</strong> Replace cracked pickets before they break completely</li>
		<li><strong>Rail condition:</strong> Check for cracks or splits in horizontal rails</li>
		<li><strong>Panel flex:</strong> Panels shouldn't feel loose or floppy between posts</li>
		<li><strong>Paint/finish:</strong> Maintain finish to prevent wood deterioration</li>
	</ul>

	<p><strong>Gate Inspection (Gates Most Vulnerable):</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Hinge security:</strong> Hinges should be tight, no looseness</li>
		<li><strong>Diagonal brace:</strong> Gate diagonal brace essential for strength</li>
		<li><strong>Latch function:</strong> Gate should close and latch easily</li>
		<li><strong>Gate posts:</strong> Most critical posts - check for any movement</li>
		<li><strong>Sag check:</strong> Gate shouldn't sag at latch end</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Post-Storm Inspection and Repair</h3>
	<p>After major wind events (40+ mph gusts), inspect for damage:</p>

	<p><strong>Immediate Actions:</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Walk entire fence line checking for leaning, damage, or loose sections</li>
		<li>Temporarily brace any leaning posts to prevent further damage</li>
		<li>Secure or remove loose boards that could become projectiles</li>
		<li>Document damage with photos for insurance if extensive</li>
		<li>Make emergency repairs before next wind event</li>
	</ul>

	<p><strong>Common Storm Damage and Fixes:</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Slight post lean:</strong> May be able to straighten and reinforce with additional concrete</li>
		<li><strong>Blown panels:</strong> Reattach with additional/stronger fasteners</li>
		<li><strong>Broken boards:</strong> Replace individual damaged boards</li>
		<li><strong>Pulled posts:</strong> Usually require complete removal and reinstallation</li>
		<li><strong>Foundation cracks:</strong> May need to excavate and replace concrete</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Real-World Wind Resistance Examples</h2>

	<h3>Case Study 1: Standard Installation Failure</h3>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Location:</strong> West Stockton, exposed lot</li>
		<li><strong>Installation:</strong> 6-ft cedar privacy, 4x4 posts 8-ft spacing, 24" depth</li>
		<li><strong>Event:</strong> 55 mph wind gusts, January 2024</li>
		<li><strong>Damage:</strong> 40 linear feet leaning 15-30 degrees, 2 posts pulled completely</li>
		<li><strong>Repair cost:</strong> $1,800 to reset posts and repair panels</li>
		<li><strong>Lesson:</strong> Standard installation inadequate for exposed Central Valley locations</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Case Study 2: Wind-Resistant Success</h3>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Location:</strong> North Stockton, open area near Delta</li>
		<li><strong>Installation:</strong> 6-ft vinyl privacy, 6x6 posts 6-ft spacing, 30" depth, 12" concrete</li>
		<li><strong>Event:</strong> Same January 2024 storm, 55+ mph gusts</li>
		<li><strong>Damage:</strong> Zero - fence performed perfectly</li>
		<li><strong>Extra cost:</strong> $1,200 more than standard installation</li>
		<li><strong>Lesson:</strong> Proper engineering prevents damage, saves money long-term</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Case Study 3: Material Selection Impact</h3>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Location:</strong> Spanos Park, moderate wind exposure</li>
		<li><strong>Installation:</strong> Ornamental aluminum, 4-ft height, standard spacing</li>
		<li><strong>Event:</strong> Multiple 40-50 mph wind events over 5 years</li>
		<li><strong>Damage:</strong> Zero - open design allows wind to pass through</li>
		<li><strong>Lesson:</strong> Material choice as important as installation for wind resistance</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Conclusion: Engineering for Success</h2>

	<p>Central Valley wind conditions demand properly engineered fencing. The difference between a fence that stands for decades and one that blows down in the first major storm comes down to post depth, spacing, size, concrete mass, and connection quality. Cutting corners on these critical elements to save $500-1,000 upfront leads to $3,000+ replacement costs and the frustration of rebuilding what should have been done right the first time.</p>

	<p>The physics of wind loads are unforgiving. A 6-foot solid fence facing 50 mph winds experiences hundreds of pounds of force trying to push it over. Only proper engineering - posts set deep enough, spaced close enough, anchored in sufficient concrete, and connected with adequate fasteners - can resist these forces year after year.</p>

	<p>Whether you're installing a new fence or evaluating an existing one before storm season, prioritize wind resistance. Increase post sizes, reduce spacing, go deeper, and use quality fasteners. The modest additional investment provides decades of worry-free performance, protects your property investment, and gives you peace of mind during every Central Valley wind event.</p>
