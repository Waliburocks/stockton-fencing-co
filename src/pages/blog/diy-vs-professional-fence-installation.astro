	<h2>Conclusion: Making Your Decision</h2>

	<p>The DIY vs. professional fence installation decision isn't purely financial - it involves time, skill, physical capability, and desired quality. While DIY installation can save 30-40% in direct costs, the true savings shrink considerably when factoring in tool purchases, time value, material waste, and potential quality issues requiring future corrections.</p>

	<p>DIY makes excellent sense for experienced, well-equipped homeowners tackling smaller projects with flexible timelines. Professional installation provides superior value for larger projects, first-time installers, time-constrained homeowners, or those prioritizing quality and warranty coverage. Consider hybrid approaches if you have specific skills but want professional expertise for challenging aspects.</p>
